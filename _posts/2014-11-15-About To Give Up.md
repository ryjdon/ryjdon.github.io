Every bolt torqued to spec. I know, I checked twice. Cut the air. Give it gasoline and a fully charged battery. Give it full spark too, hot and blue at each cylinder. Give it a try. The engine fires off a few stubborn sputters, and nothing more. Make a list, and make your way down it testing each variable. Test the air. Test the gasoline and battery. A test of patience, and try it again. 

Just as completing any task is a process, so is giving up. What I thought was going to be an "easy" top end rebuild on my 1980 Honda CB650 has been anything but. A long weekend turned into an even longer month. The mild fall weather has started slipping into the bitter range. Hands get colder and clumsy. Corners get rounded a bit, threads stretch and strip. The progress came fast at first. The engine was disassembled with ease, and went back together with little resistance. Step by step, my confidence grew. Surely what was a running engine before would appreciate this close attention. And when I was done, the key would turn, ignition would spark, and the Adam of my labors would awake with a youthful heart and soul. 

A part of me still believes this. There must be something I’m overlooking, something left to unearth. Of course there would be. Learning something new has never been a walk in the park. There’s always a bit of struggle and failing that goes into making progress. I’m actually a big fan of these little miss steps. They’re fun to reflect back on. Perhaps my favorite nugget of clumsiness in my recent past is looking at pictures of some of my first latte art. I went from white blobs of thick foam, to making oddly phallic blob lattes. I hoped no one paid too much attention. From there, I started making some other shapes; crooked trees, lopsided hearts, what I loosely described as “tulips”. And, by the end of my seven year tenure as a barista, I could confidently hold my own with some of the best in Portland. 

But my improvements didn’t follow a straight path. I would learn a new technique and get better for a bit, and then somehow forget how my hands were supposed to work. Serving an ugly latte to someone was even worse. I’d avoid eye contact and timidly slide the drink over. Try to frantically distract them with a bad joke. All the while knowing that I could do better. At worst, they would scoff and reach for a lid, or the artificial sweetener. Empty five packs while staring at the wall and give it a sloppy stir. I wanted the scorn. And since coffee was a sustaining paycheck, I had a constant flow of varied reactions and plenty of time to improve on my technique. 


No one is paying me to fix my motorcycle. In fact, I’ve now spent more on repairs than I did on purchasing the bike. The money doesn’t bother me though. When it’s all said and done, I will have learned how to rebuild and troubleshoot a motorcycle engine. That’s valuable. That’s something that’ll be helpful in an End of The World ebola-zombie type future, I think. 

Right now though, I’m ready to give up. My hands are sore and stink of gasoline. I’ve checked the torque on every bolt, cut the air, made sure the battery was charged. I’ve checked the spark at each cylinder. It’s hot and blue. 
But I’m right there. The only thing standing in the way of success, is death. And the thought of just setting it all aside indefinitely is appealing. Hell, it’s down right sexy. 

This is the process of giving up. The brief moment Nike ad slogans are created for. It’s cold out, and I have Netflix. But, I did get the bike to sputter a little bit despite the heavy drip of gasoline from a leaky fuel line. It wouldn’t hurt to sleep on it for a bit and wait for another weekend. This is the same hesitation you have before actually embarking on a project. Just greater risk. There’s no neat ending for this. Just a list. Check the valves and the cam timing, fix the leak,  give it gas, charge the battery, cut the air, give it a try.
