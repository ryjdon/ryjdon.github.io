It shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone over the age of 25 that success is a long and sometimes arduous journey filled with a series of failures. When you set out to accomplish something new, you’re bound to make mistakes, run into difficulties, get pissed off, knock the skin off a few knuckles, or bruise your ego. Making mistakes is, perhaps, what people do best. But hey, that’s how you get better. You regroup, dust yourself off, get back on the horse, mend your wounds, and know deep down that you won’t make THAT mistake again. We all know this. We wouldn’t be able to walk or dress appropriately if it wasn’t for this process. So, why the heck don’t we remember this inherent life lesson when we start a new project? 

One reason may be that success, from an outside perspective, seems to be easily acquired with nothing more than sheer determination. I was recently reminded of this when I watched the nearly saccharine Summer heart-warmer, [Chef](http://www.avclub.com/review/jon-favreau-gets-back-his-indie-rootssort-comedy-c-204357) starring Jon Favreau as a hot-headed chef who returns to his culinary roots and reinvents his career in a food truck. Quick disclosure: I’m not a movie critic. I feel confident in my ability to identify a good film when I see one, but by and large movies will always give me a sort of childlike delight for their pure entertainment value. So, this movie that was meant to be a feel-good flick did just that. However, the thing that struck me, and the reason I’m bringing this movie up, is the role that Favreau’s on-screen son plays in the success of the food truck. The son, played by Emjay Anthony, is portrayed as a stereotypical young Millennial—short attention span, eyes glued to a smartphone, and possessing an almost preternatural knack for social media marketing. 

I feel the need to get a couple of things straight. 1) Not all Millennials are social media experts. 2) The basics of social media are easy to understand, no matter what your age or technological background is. Being social whether you’re on the internet or off is about sharing the things you’re interested in. Chances are, there’s someone else out there who shares the same interest and wants to connect. And, when they do connect with you, **WAMMO!** You now have yourself a social media network. If you’re just starting out on a new social media platform you’re bound to make a few mistakes. But who really cares? While your audience is small you can play around, test things out, and learn the ropes while you make friends and grow your network.  

Success for a Social Media Marketer looks a little different. Actually, a lot different. Social Media is only one small way that people gain exposure to brands. As a company grows, so does their exposure. So, it’s only logical that if you’re posting to social media regularly, your social following will grow. The tricky part, and where you can experience some of your biggest failures is in maintaining the communities you acquire. How do you create posts and content your followers will like? How do you keep up with the contact? What happens if people start getting angry with the company? If you’re currently faced with these types of questions, I’d suggest checking out the following blogs to get some tips and ideas:

It can be difficult to plan for setbacks when you’re building what you hope to be a successful social media strategy. People are fickle and you’re almost guaranteed to find someone with vehemently opposite opinions and values to those you hold. I also like to do a little soul searching before I post anything on social media. If I think something is funny, will other people? Will they be offended? And, if there’s risk of someone taking something the wrong way, is that a risk I’m (or the company) is willing to take. Oh, and in case this isn’t clear, when I talk about making mistakes on social media, I don’t mean doing things like [this](http://www.searchenginejournal.com/35-social-media-fails/95613/). The internet will last forever, people. Doing a gut check with yourself and a few other people before you post can save you eternal shame. 

The more likely mistake you’ll run into is thinking that a piece of content you’re promoting or a campaign you spent months on will be a wild success, but just ends up falling flat. Gathering data and making informed decisions when you’re coming up with a strategy can do wonders for a good idea. Ultimately though, there’s no substitute for trial and error. Be prolific! And when something does work, take the time to figure out why and how you can repeat it.
