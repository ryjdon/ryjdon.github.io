Earlier this week, I was buying spark plug wire from the local motorcycle/coffee shop (because it’s the Pacific Northwest and of course that exists). The barista, decked in heavily worn black t-shirt and trucker hat, asked me what I was up to. “Just doing a spark plug job,” I say as casually as I can. To which he replies, “Well, that’s where it all starts.” I paused for a second, taken aback at how aptly punny this cool dood had just been. He could have just been referring to the slippery slope of motorcycle repair, sure. Instead, I preferred the inside baseball witticism about the raw function of the spark plug: providing the essential electrical charge to the vaporized fuel in the combustion chambers of a motorcycle so the pistons can fire and start the engine. Such clever retorts usually just deserve a chuckle, so why start a blog post (and a blog) out this way? 

Well, there are subtleties to beginnings. Whether you’re crafting the first lyrical sentence to the next Great American Novel, learning how to drive stick shift in an empty highschool parking lot, or just making a grocery list, there’s a hesitation before you start. You need to make sure you’re committed to the task at hand. You check your mirrors, peek in the fridge, set the scene in your head. But most importantly, you define the rules. The basic set of guiding principles you’ll need in order to accomplish what you set out to do. For our purpose in this blog post, that means we need to talk about why this blog exists. 



A few weeks back, I sent an email to my co-worker and friend, Sarah Eadie, suggesting we both start blogs. The basic gist of it was to have accountability to production. I work best when I know that I have a partner in crime, and I work even harder when I know that partner is naturally more prolific with their work than I am. Maybe I like the competition, or maybe I just like having someone who’s going to to set the bar high enough for me to feel challenged. Either way, I knew that suggesting a minimum of two blog posts a month was going to be a challenge for me, and I had a hunch that Sarah would be game for the task. 

###Challenge accepted. 
A couple of dusky post-work beers later, we had the framework planned. The rules:

1. Each person agrees to write two blog posts a month of at least 750 words.
2. The due date for each post is the 1st and the 15th of each month respectively. 
3. Topic can be anything we find interesting enough to write about. 
4. Images and videos are not required, but are encouraged...because we’re not savages!
5. Commenting on each other’s blog is a good thing, so we’re going to do that at least once a month. It’s nice to have at least one person cheer you on! 
6. Bonus points for style.

7. And last (and most importantly), if either one of us doesn’t get a post written by the time the deadline rolls around, the other person gets to write a guest post of any length about anything they want. I’m not saying public shaming is the goal, but it’s going to be hard NOT to publicly shame the other person. 
 
###So, what kind of stuff can we expect from this blog?

If you haven’t already gathered from my opening tangent, I dig motorcycles. I picked up a 1980 Honda CB650 this summer. She’s a cute little redhead with a smoking problem. She’s also sprung a few leaks and her shiny bits are a bit tarnished. But, that’s life! I still think she’s a cutie, and have been feeding her compliments (read money) in the hopes that we’ll have many great years together. I’m a sucker for fixer-uppers and get a kick out of being methodical with my repair work. You spend a lot of time with your own thoughts when you’re doing mechanical work. So it’s likely you, gentle reader, will hear more life lessons gleaned from greasy hands. 

I’m also trying to do myself a favor professionally with this blog, which is to say, I hope I get a lot of people reading these posts that say to themselves out loud, regardless of the people around them, “Dang, this Ryan guy is a smartie pants! He’s got a lot of interesting things to say about social media marketing. He’s also very handsome, and I bet he’s really fun to get to know and have meaningful conversations with.” Ok, ok, so it’s probably just going to be my mom saying ALL of that. But, I am planning out a few posts that talk about social media that I hope will be interesting to read, even if you aren’t into the whole marketing side of things. People connecting with other people on the internet is a pretty neat thing. So is public opinion. Great things can happen when people connect and organize around a common belief. Some not so great things can happen too. I’m interested in the role social media channels play into this flavor of fickle social behavior. 

Ok, so here we go! Let’s get this challenge started. You all should check out [Sarah’s Blog](http://saraheadie.com) to admire her excessive use of sparkle text, and start following me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/watersandwich) and [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/watersandwich).
