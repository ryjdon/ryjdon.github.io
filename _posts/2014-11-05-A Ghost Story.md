The leaves hang heavier on their branches after a good rain. They block out the stars you would be able to see if the clouds weren’t also thick and droopy. At night, most light is blocked out except the yellow dim from the street lamps and the occasional TV flash from a warm living room. The streets of inner SE Portland get spooky this time of year. This is how it was a few night ago. All of my senses heightened. I was being haunted. I was also a ghost. I almost didn’t register the first animalistic shriek followed by a crash of wood and metal coming from the distance ahead of me. As I continued walking into the dark, another crash followed by another scream—louder this time. It wasn’t quite human sounding, but I couldn’t place the animal. Then silence. 

I noticed a man walking his dog ahead of me in the quiet. They both had stopped and were looking around for the cause of the commotion. I thought about Rose. How she looked back to see if we would make eye contact before she rounded the corner. How we’d probably never hold hands or stare out the same window again. This brief digression was abruptly ended when, out from the side of a house up ahead, ran a bright orange chicken. It bolted down the driveway and right out into the middle of the street clucking its head off all the way. It then swerved towards me with a crazed looked in its eyes. It was only then that I noticed the woman in her pajamas and slippers hot on the chicken’s trail. The only thing missing was a rolling pin in her hand or curlers in her hair. The man with the dog and I were frozen solid, still trying to register what was unfolding in front of us. Do we help? Luckily before I had to make a heroic dive for the wild poultry, it took refuge in a nearby bush. The man with the dog and I helped corner the bush, and the PJ’d woman reached into the black and plucked out the chicken. The drama was done. 

I can’t quite remember the last time I was that amused. I must’ve sounded like a crazy person laughing about it in the dark as I continued walking to my friend’s house. But it felt good to laugh. It seemed almost cathartic to put more importance of a runaway chicken than on the break-up that had just taken place. More important, and more worth my thoughts. 

The break-up conversation was not atypical. The relationship had been relatively short, so it made sense to keep our conversation brief. No sense talking a moot point to death. But I’d be lying if I said I didn’t start to fall into my usual trappings. The wave of self-doubt is imminent. Yet there I was, moments after an emotional drain, feeling better than I had in a very long time. 

Allowing yourself the capacity to enjoy the moment you’re in is intrinsic to living well. This isn’t a new concept. If you’ve ever dabbled in writings on mindfulness or Zen Buddhism, you see pretty quickly that being open to a concept of “the now” is important to finding regular happiness. By the way, if you’re looking for something good to read, I highly recommend [Being Peace by Thich Nhat Hanh](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/331344.Being_Peace). Still though, it’s one thing to read these books or hear this advice from someone else. After a bad break-up, everyone has advice. But maybe there isn’t just a magic answer to make heartache easier to take. Maybe there doesn’t need to be one. 

The chicken escaped at just the right time. It’s would-be exodus couldn’t have been better timed. And, even though the chaos was brief, the feeling of being able to let go and only focus on what was happening at that time is something to hold onto. That chicken lifted me up and gave me something to be excited about. And, all I had to do was be in the right place at the right time. Or maybe all I had to do was just laugh at it all.
